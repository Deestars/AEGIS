# 🛡️ AEGIS - Poultry Health Monitoring System

A proof-of-concept dashboard built with Streamlit that simulates an early warning system for detecting disease outbreaks in poultry farms using IoT sensor data.

## 🚀 Overview

AEGIS uses simulated data from water consumption, activity, and temperature sensors to calculate a real-time "Flock Health Score." It provides farmers with critical, early warnings of potential disease outbreaks **days before they become visible**, enabling proactive intervention to prevent catastrophic losses.

## ✨ Features

-   **Real-time Dashboard:** Live monitoring of key health metrics.
-   **Predictive Health Scoring:** Proprietary algorithm correlates sensor data to generate a predictive health score.
-   **Automated Alert System:** Triggers immediate visual alerts with recommended actions when thresholds are breached.
-   **Interactive Historical Charts:** Visualize trends and pinpoint the exact onset of anomalies using Plotly.
-   **Farm Management Controls:** Adjust flock size and alert sensitivity.

## 🛠️ Built With

-   **Python** - Core programming language
-   **Streamlit** - Web framework for building the UI
-   **Plotly** - Interactive graphing and visualization
-   **Pandas & NumPy** - Data manipulation and analysis
